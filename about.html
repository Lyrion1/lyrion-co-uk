            <h3>The Cloth of Celestial Intent</h3>
            <p>We do not merely create apparel; we translate the mystic and metaphysical into form. LYRĪON is a celestial couture house born from the deep understanding that life is a rhythm, governed by the silent, ceaseless dance of the planets. Our pieces are tactile, wearable constellations—designed for those who live with ritual and intention.</p>
            <p>The LYRĪON signature is forged in the alchemy of luxury design and cosmic alignment. Every stitch, every silhouette, every hue of cream, ink, and gold is an invocation. We merge the timeless artistry of the cosmos with contemporary elegance, crafting garments that are both an intimate reflection of your inner zodiac and a statement of curated luxury.</p>

            <h3>The Architects of Intention</h3>
            <p>Our journey began with a question: What if clothing could be more than just fabric? What if it could be a conduit?</p>
            <p>From this intention, LYRĪON sourced the finest materials—organic cotton and silks chosen not just for their feel, but for their ability to hold energy. Our Zodiac line is not mass-produced; it is made-to-order, ensuring that each garment is imbued with the fresh energy of the commission, arriving to you as a bespoke vessel of your astrological identity.</p>
            <p>We honor negative space as much as design, reflecting the elegant silence between the stars. We believe true luxury lies in the story, the material, and the intention woven into every piece.</p>

            <h3>Our Covenant with the Stars</h3>
            <p>LYRĪON is a commitment to living consciously. We invite you to wear your story, to walk in rhythm with the celestial blueprint, and to feel the potent connection between the body and the heavens.</p>
            <p>This is not fast fashion; this is slow luxury. This is **Celestial Couture**.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.4rem; font-family: var(--font-serif); margin-top: 3rem; color: var(--color-ink);">Welcome to the house of **LYRĪON**.</p>
